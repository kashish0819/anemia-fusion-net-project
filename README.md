## 📌 Overview

AnemiaFusionNet is an AI-powered healthcare application designed for rapid and non-invasive anemia screening. The system combines three complementary sources of information:

- 👁️ Conjunctival Eye Images
- 🩸 Clinical Laboratory Parameters
- 🌍 Regional Anemia Risk Information

These heterogeneous data sources are fused using a deep learning framework to improve prediction performance compared to using a single modality.

The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

# ✨ Features

- Deep learning-based eye image analysis
- Clinical data prediction
- Regional risk feature integration
- Multimodal feature fusion
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Real-time AI prediction
- Modern responsive dashboard
- Explainable prediction report

---

# 🧠 Model Architecture

The system consists of three independent AI models:

### 👁️ Image Branch
- EfficientNetB0
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction

### 🩸 Clinical Branch
Uses laboratory parameters:

- Hemoglobin (Hb)
- MCH
- MCHC
- MCV
- Gender

### 🌍 Geo Branch

Includes regional anemia prevalence information for improving prediction robustness.

### 🔗 Fusion Layer

Outputs from all three branches are concatenated and passed through fully connected layers for final anemia prediction.
